DESCRIPTION
This project demonstrates how to build a simple LED flasher circuit using the popular 555 timer IC in astable mode. The 555 timer generates a square wave output that turns the LED ON and OFF periodically, creating a blinking effect. This is a basic electronics project ideal for beginners learning about timers, waveform generation, and simple circuit design.

Features:
1.Blinks an LED at a steady rate.

2.Uses 555 timer in astable mode.

3.Adjustable blinking rate using variable resistor or different RC values.

4.Low-cost and easy to build.

Components required:
1.555 Timer IC
2.Resistors
3.Capacitor
4.Breadboard & Wires
5.LED
6.Power Supply

Circuit Explanation:
The 555 timer is working in astable mode.Two resistors and one capacitor are used in this circuit.

Steps involved:
1.Put the 555 timer on breadboard.
2.Connect pin 8 to Vcc and pin 1 to ground.
3.Short circuit pin 2 and pin 6.
4.Connect pin 4 to Vcc.
5.Connect R1 to pin 2/6 and and pin 7.
6.Connect R2 to Vcc and and pin 7.
7.Capacitor to pin 2/6 and ground
8.LED to output 3 and R3.
#capacitor will discharge through R1.
